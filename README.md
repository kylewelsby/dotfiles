> Setup script to install and configure a new macOS installation with my applications and system dependencies.

This has all my important dotfiles which define my working environment.

Automation install script inspired by [Jason Yu](https://github.com/ycmjason/dotfiles).

## ðŸŽ² Installation

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/kylewelsby/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## ðŸ¤– Testing

Well, about that.  At the moment, to test this we need to run the script on our own machine.
